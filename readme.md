/*COVID-19 WEB APP*/  
as a user, I can...  
- search coronavirus data by one of 50 US states 
- GET number of confirmed cases YTD by chosen state - GET number of deaths YTD by chosen state 
- GET description of areas in the state that have been hardest hit - GET date of first confirmed case 
- COMPARE 2 states maybe? (future feature idea) 
- GET a timeline between infection dates to show progression maybe? (future feature idea) - search by country 
- GET same data and feature ideas as the US
